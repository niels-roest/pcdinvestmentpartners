            <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
                <span class="inline-block px-3 py-1 text-xs font-semibold tracking-wider text-brand-blue bg-brand-blue/10 rounded-full uppercase mb-4">The challenge</span>
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">The data silo problem in healthcare</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The average healthcare organization in the Netherlands works with <strong class="text-navy-900">15 to 25 different software systems</strong>. From the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) to scheduling software, billing systems, client portals, and reporting tools &ndash; each system contains a piece of the puzzle, but no single system shows the complete picture.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Patient data becomes fragmented across dozens of databases that do not communicate with each other. A general practitioner sees different information than the specialist at the hospital, and the district nurse is missing both perspectives. The result: healthcare providers spend valuable time searching for information instead of delivering care.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">This fragmentation leads to duplicate registrations, conflicting data, and &ndash; in the worst case &ndash; medical errors. Clinicians enter the same information multiple times, in different systems, because there is no centralized overview. The administrative burden this creates is one of the primary causes of workload pressure and burnout among healthcare professionals.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">The absence of a single coherent client view also means that patterns remain invisible. When data is isolated, organizations cannot identify trends, predict risks, or design personalized care pathways. The data exists &ndash; but the insights do not.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">When healthcare data is actually connected, something powerful emerges: patterns become visible, and insights that were previously hidden come to light. Connected data is the key to a fundamentally different way of delivering care &ndash; proactive instead of reactive, personalized instead of generic.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">When a healthcare professional can view the complete medical history, ongoing treatments, and current measurements at a single glance, clinical decisions become better substantiated. Fewer assumptions, more evidence-based care.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">By combining data from different sources &ndash; from wearables to lab results &ndash; deviating patterns can be detected early.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">With a complete data picture, care pathways can be tailored to the individual client. Not every patient is the same &ndash; and when we can substantiate that with data, the quality of care demonstrably improves.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Quality indicators are only meaningful when they are based on complete and reliable data. Connected systems make it possible to structurally measure, compare, and improve outcomes &ndash; without manual data collection.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">The future of data-driven care</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The transition from data silos to connected healthcare data is only the beginning. The real transformation occurs when artificial intelligence and machine learning are applied to these integrated datasets. Where connected data makes patterns visible, AI can interpret those patterns, make predictions, and support healthcare providers in complex decisions.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Predictive analytics for prevention</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">With sufficient historical and real-time data, predictive models can identify at-risk patients before complaints escalate. Think of early detection of readmission risk, predicting falls among the elderly, or detecting psychological decompensation in mental healthcare. Prevention thus becomes not just an ambition, but a data-driven reality.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Population health management</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">At a regional and national level, connected healthcare data enables monitoring of population health and targeted interventions. Which neighborhoods have the highest disease burden? Where is the intake into mental healthcare strongest? Which prevention programs are most effective? With data-driven insights, the focus shifts from treatment to prevention.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">EHDS and Wegiz as accelerators</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">The regulatory context is accelerating the development of data-driven care. The European Health Data Space (EHDS) creates a European framework for safely sharing health data across borders. In the Netherlands, the Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Act (Wegiz) mandates digital data exchange. This legislation confirms what CareHub is already putting into practice: open standards as the foundation for interoperability.</p>
