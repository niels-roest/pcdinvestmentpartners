                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">The fragmented healthcare landscape</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Dutch healthcare ranks among the best in the world, but behind the scenes the sector is grappling with a fundamental problem: more than <strong class="text-navy-900">1,000 different software systems</strong> that barely communicate with each other. From electronic client records (ECRs) and GP information systems to pharmacy software and imaging platforms &ndash; each system operates as a standalone island.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The consequences are felt at every level. Patients must share their medical history anew with each care provider. GPs have no visibility into medication prescribed by a specialist. Nurses manually enter the same data into multiple systems. This fragmentation leads not only to frustration, but also to medical risks: information that is not available in time can lead to incorrect diagnoses or unnecessary duplicate examinations.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Recent research shows that <strong class="text-navy-900">70% of healthcare organisations</strong> are actively seeking solutions for better data exchange. There is a growing recognition that interoperability &ndash; the ability of systems to seamlessly exchange and interpret data &ndash; is no longer a luxury, but an absolute necessity for future-proof care.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">The question is no longer <em>whether</em> interoperability will come, but <em>how</em> we accelerate the transition to an integrated healthcare landscape. In this article, we analyse the legislative, technical and practical dimensions of this transformation.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The government has recognised the urgency of interoperability and translated it into concrete legislation. The <strong class="text-navy-900">Wet elektronische gegevensuitwisseling in de zorg (Wegiz)</strong>, adopted by the Dutch Senate, mandates care providers to exchange patient data electronically. This is a historic step: for the first time, digital data exchange is no longer voluntary, but legally required.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Wegiz introduces phased requirements for electronic data exchange. The first tranche makes medication transfer and nursing handover mandatory in digital form. Subsequent tranches will extend this to laboratory results, imaging reports and referral letters. Software vendors must demonstrate that their systems comply with the stipulated interoperability standards.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">At the European level, the <strong class="text-navy-900">European Health Data Space (EHDS)</strong> creates a uniform framework for health data. This framework enables a Dutch patient who requires care in Germany or Spain to access their medical records. The EHDS additionally encourages the secondary use of anonymised data for research and policymaking.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-2">IZA: ambitions for 2026</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">The Integraal Zorgakkoord (IZA) translates this legislation into concrete ambitions. The objective for 2026 is that all relevant care providers can exchange data digitally in accordance with established standards. This requires investment in infrastructure, training and cultural change within healthcare organisations.</p>

Healthcare organisations that invest in interoperable systems now are not only positioning themselves in compliance with the law, but are also building a competitive advantage that will prove crucial in the years ahead.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">HL7 (Health Level Seven) has been the international standard for exchanging medical messages for decades. The protocol defines how clinical and administrative data is structured and transmitted between systems.

Unlike traditional message exchange, FHIR works with modern RESTful APIs &ndash; the same technology that powers applications such as iDEAL and DigiD. Data is structured in &ldquo;resources&rdquo; (e.g. Patient, Observation, MedicationRequest) that can be queried and shared in real time. This makes FHIR exceptionally well-suited for mobile applications, patient portals and integrations across different care domains.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Within CareHub, interoperability is not an afterthought, but the architectural principle. All connected companies implement FHIR interfaces and HL7 connections, enabling data to flow in real time between systems without manual intervention or duplicate data entry.</p>
                    </div>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">What distinguishes CareHub from standalone integrations is the <strong class="text-navy-900">ecosystem approach</strong>. Instead of point-to-point connections &ndash; which grow exponentially in complexity &ndash; CareHub offers a shared integration layer. When a new healthtech company joins, it is immediately connected to all existing participants. This drastically reduces integration costs and shortens implementation time from months to weeks.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">PCD Investment Partners selects and supports healthtech companies that demonstrably contribute to the interoperability ambition. By providing shared services in the areas of compliance, governance and technical architecture, PCD ensures that all ecosystem participants comply with Wegiz requirements, NEN7510 standards and FHIR specifications.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">The result: interoperability that does not remain theoretical on whitepapers, but functions daily in the practice of healthcare organisations throughout the Netherlands.</p>
