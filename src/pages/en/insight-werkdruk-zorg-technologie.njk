        <section class="py-16 lg:py-20 bg-white" aria-label="The healthcare sector under pressure">
            <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
                <span class="inline-block px-3 py-1 text-xs font-semibold tracking-wider text-brand-blue bg-brand-blue/10 rounded-full uppercase mb-4">Background</span>
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">The healthcare sector under pressure</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The Dutch healthcare sector is facing one of the greatest challenges in its history. The staff shortage is growing steadily: there are currently tens of thousands of vacancies in healthcare that remain structurally unfilled. Research shows that <strong class="text-navy-900">1 in 6 healthcare workers</strong> is seriously considering leaving the sector &ndash; not because of the work itself, but because of the workload and the circumstances surrounding it.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">At the same time, care demand is increasing substantially. The ageing population means that the Netherlands will face a <strong class="text-navy-900">rise in care demand of 30 to 40 percent by 2030</strong> in the coming years. More elderly people who wish to live at home longer, more chronic conditions and a more complex care need &ndash; it requires more hands at the bedside, while those hands are simply not available.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The consequences are visible throughout the entire chain. Burnout rates among nurses are considerably higher than the national average. In mental healthcare, waiting times extend to months, while clients urgently need help. Professionals feel they have too little time for the core of their profession: caring for people.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">This is not a temporary problem. The combination of demographic shifts and a tight labour market makes it clear that healthcare requires structural solutions. Working harder is no longer an option &ndash; working smarter is a necessity.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">Where does the time go?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Before we look at solutions, it is essential to understand where the time of healthcare professionals actually goes. Study after study confirms the same picture: on average, healthcare workers spend <strong class="text-navy-900">40% of their working time on administration</strong>. That is nearly half of every working day not spent on direct care delivery.</p>

                <div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">The same information must be entered into multiple systems because they do not communicate with each other. A nurse enters client data into the ECR, then again into the scheduling system and once more into the billing system. This not only costs time, but also increases the risk of errors.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-2">Searching for information</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Relevant client information is scattered across different systems and departments. Professionals spend valuable minutes looking up records, consulting colleagues and navigating through non-integrated applications.</p>

                    <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-2">Telephone coordination</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Coordination between departments, referrers and chain partners still largely takes place via telephone and email. It takes multiple attempts to reach the right person, leading to delays in care delivery.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-2">Paper-based processes</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Despite digitalisation, many healthcare organisations still work with forms, faxes and manual workflows that could easily be digitised. Think of intake forms, consent declarations and reports that are still maintained on paper.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">The result is a vicious cycle: high administrative burdens lead to more workload, which leads to more attrition, which leads to even higher workload for the remaining staff. To break this cycle, a fundamentally different approach is needed.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">Workflow automation as a structural solution</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Let one thing be clear: technology is not there to replace people. The goal of workflow automation in healthcare is to <strong class="text-navy-900">free professionals from repetitive tasks</strong>, so they have more time for what truly matters &ndash; personal contact with clients and patients.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">Concrete applications of workflow automation that have a direct impact on daily practice:</p>

                <div class="space-y-8 mb-8">
                    <div class="flex gap-4">

                            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Referrals are automatically processed, classified and routed to the appropriate department or practitioner. This saves hours of manual processing per week and significantly reduces waiting times for clients.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Clients complete questionnaires at home via a secure portal. The responses automatically flow into the ECR, ensuring the professional already has the relevant information at the first consultation &ndash; without manual data entry.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Intelligent scheduling software takes into account availability, travel time, competencies and client preferences. This reduces the time team leaders spend on rostering and optimises the deployment of scarce staff.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-2">Integration between ECR and other systems</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">When systems communicate seamlessly with each other, the need for duplicate data entry disappears. The <a href="{{ langPrefix }}/carehub-zorg-digitalisering" class="text-brand-blue hover:text-brand-blue-dark font-medium">CareHub ecosystem</a> of PCD is specifically designed for this: an open platform in which complementary healthcare technologies work together via standardised connections.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">These forms of automation are not a distant prospect. They are already being successfully deployed at healthcare organisations across the country today. The difference lies in the approach: not implementing one standalone system, but building an ecosystem in which everything works together.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">In addition to workflow automation, there are specific digital tools that measurably reduce workload in healthcare. The power lies in the combination: when these tools are interconnected, they amplify each other&rsquo;s effect.</p>

                <div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-10">

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Clients and informal carers gain access to a secure portal where they can view appointments, upload documents and send messages. This reduces the number of phone calls and gives clients greater control over their own care process.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Not every consultation requires an in-person visit. Video consultations enable hybrid care models where face-to-face contact is combined with digital check-ins. This saves travel time for professionals and is accessible for clients.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">By analysing data intelligently, risks can be identified early. Think of recognising patterns that indicate a deterioration in health, enabling proactive intervention rather than reactive responses.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Reports for care offices, municipalities and internal quality metrics can largely be automated. This not only saves time, but also increases the accuracy and consistency of the data.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The results speak for themselves. In our <a href="{{ langPrefix }}/cases" class="text-brand-blue hover:text-brand-blue-dark font-medium">portfolio cases</a>, we see that an integrated approach to digital tools can lead to a <strong class="text-navy-900">reduction in administrative burdens of 60%</strong>.

                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6">Preserving the human touch</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">With all the technological possibilities, one principle remains paramount: technology must strengthen the humanity in care, not replace it. The value of a listening ear, an encouraging look or a warm hand cannot be digitised &ndash; and it should not be.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">What can and should be digitised are the processes that keep professionals away from that human contact. Every minute a nurse saves on administration is a minute she can spend with her clients. Every action a system can take over automatically is one less action that can lead to errors or frustration.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">This is why it is crucial to choose technology that fits existing work processes. Solutions imposed top-down without support on the work floor are destined to fail. The best digital tools are those that healthcare professionals themselves experience as supportive.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">PCD Investment Partners takes a clear approach in this regard: we invest in <strong class="text-navy-900">proven technologies that integrate seamlessly</strong> with the systems healthcare organisations already use. Through the CareHub ecosystem, we connect complementary solutions into one coherent whole &ndash; without the work floor having to undergo a complete system change.</p>
